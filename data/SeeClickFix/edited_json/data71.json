This is an area that is already VERY difficult to find parking in as a resident and it is made only worse when the Russian Embassy fills the streets with their guest's cars. Is it legal for them to do this? Do they have to have a special permit? I've watched many times as the valets park cars and run back the Russian Embassy. I saw a pack of Valets walking to the embassy today around 5 PM and it reminded me of how furstrating the issue is! They also frequently do this around the time that residents are coming home and trying to park. The issue is also exacerbated by the fact that 10 spots of more were recently (past year) taken away from Wisconsin when the street was repaved and a turn lane was put in in sections. Any help??

The two streets intersect at a dangerous 40ft ravine, that is a part of Alger Park sidewalks on the 3,000 block of V place, SE. For nearly 4 years, neighbors have tried to get City officials to address this issue especially the erosion to these streets and private property resulting from the ravine. \nNearly a year ago, representatives from DDOT conducted a walk through of the 3000 Block of V Place, SE and the 2000 block of 30th  Street  to determine the condition of these streets and the need for curbs, gutters and sidewalks. The follow-up report and photos from DDOT exposed the following:\n1. The poor conditions of the streets to carry storm water runoff to a safe outlet.\n2. The storm water drainage issue should be reported to DPW along with a request for an inlet/outlet drainage system. \n3. Both sides of the 3000 block of \u201cV\u201d Place are approximate 150 FT. The northeast corner of \u201cV\u201d Place at 30th Street is about 50 FT., between 30\u201d to 36\u201d slope, and the storm water drainage collection system is non-existent in this area. \n4. At the 30th Street side of the north east corner at \u201cV\u201d Place, the asphalt on both sides of \u201cV\u201d Place and the curb is missing or in very poor condition.  This block was identified as a candidate for a resurfacing design upgrade. \n5. The driveway south side of the 3000 Block of \u201cV\u201d Place is in poor condition.\nThe report concluded that a request would be made to DPW for a resurfacing design to include sidewalks, curbs and gutters for the 3000 block of \u201cV\u201d Place, S.E. and the 2000 block of\n30th Street; Asset Management should place this request on their design/construction schedule.\n\n\n \n \n", "reporter": {"name": "An anonymous SeeClickFix user", "witty_title": "Street Smart", "civic_points": 0, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/anonymous-avatar-150x150.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/anonymous-avatar-100x100-127a80e459a3fd9874ad8556fb9140ffa2f046dec0dbebe1ff67e922098c8c02.png"}, "id": 0}, "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/530281", "address": "3000 Block Of V Place And 2000 Block Of 30th Streets SE, Washington, District of Columbia", "lat": 38.8646779, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/530281", "created_at": "2013-05-20T22:26:01-04:00", "acknowledged_at": null, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/530281/comments"}, {"rating": 2, "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.0293814400982, 38.9294731670552]}, "updated_at": "2014-09-02T00:03:36-04:00", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/530251/flag", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/10gqLOJ", "closed_at": null, "lng": -77.0293814400982, "summary": "Other", "id": 530251, "transitions": {"close_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/530251/close"}, "media": {"image_square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0012/6111/1369099788241_square.jpg", "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0012/6111/1369099788241_square.jpg", "video_url": null, "image_full": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0012/6111/1369099788241.jpg"}, "reopened_at": null, "status": "Open", "description": "Chain link fence repair at Tubman ES @ the SE corner of 13th & Kenyon, just outside the parking lot exit.
